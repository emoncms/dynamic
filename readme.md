## Dynamic - Open Source Dynamic Building Energy Model

An open source simple RC dynamic building energy model. Combine input power, temperature and solar data from monitoring with a simple RC model to estimate the heat loss rate of the building.

Repository also contains direct heating and heatpump simulation example.

### Dynamic model based coheating test 

A multi-stage dynamic RC type model of a building appears to give a good fit to monitored internal temperature in a simple building.
